## Installation

CRAN version:

```r
install.packages("highcharter")
```

Development version:

```r
remotes::install_github("jbkunst/highcharter")
```

## How to start

There are a lot of vignettes to show how highcharter works and what you 
can do:

- `vignette("highcharter")` explore the basics of the package. 
- `vignette("showcase")` to see how much highcharts is flexible in terms of 
customization and design.
- `vignette("highcharts-api")` show the main functions to configure charts with
the implemented Highcharts API.
- `vignette("highchartsjs-api-basics")` explain the relationship between the
highchartsJS API and highcharter.

## Performance

Processing by Highcharter can be resource intensive; e.g. parsing data structures in R and into the **Highcharts JSON format**. Depending on your usage of the package there can be a benefit in tweaking the performance options:

* `options(highcharter.boost = TRUE)`, activates base R function for parsing data structures within R.
* `options(highcharter.rjson = TRUE)`, activates rjson::toJSON() instead of the standard shiny::toJSON().

The performance options can be a factor 10x faster, but it is recommended to check the compatibility with your usage. By default the performance options are turned off.

## Licence 

Highcharter has a dependency on Highcharts, a commercial JavaScript charting library. Highcharts offers both a commercial license as well as a free non-commercial license. Please review the licensing options and terms before using this software, as the `highcharter` license neither provides nor implies a license for Highcharts.

Highcharts (https://highcharts.com) is a Highsoft product which is not free for commercial and Governmental use.

## Discount for highcharter users
