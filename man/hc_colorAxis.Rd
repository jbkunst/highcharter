\description{
A color axis for series. Visually, the color
axis will appear as a gradient or as separate items inside the
legend, depending on whether the axis is scalar or based on data
classes.
For supported color formats, see the
docs article about colors.
A scalar color axis is represented by a gradient. The colors either
range between the minColor and the
maxColor, or for more fine grained control the
colors can be defined in stops. Often times, the
color axis needs to be adjusted to get the right color spread for the
data. In addition to stops, consider using a logarithmic
axis type, or setting min and
max to avoid the colors being determined by
outliers.
When dataClasses are used, the ranges are
subdivided into separate classes like categories based on their
values. This can be used for ranges between two values, but also for
a true category. However, when your data is categorized, it may be as
convenient to add each category to a separate series.
Color axis does not work with: sankey, sunburst, dependencywheel,
networkgraph, wordcloud, venn, gauge and solidgauge series
types.
Since v7.2.0 colorAxis can also be an array of options objects.
See the Axis object for
programmatic access to the axis.
